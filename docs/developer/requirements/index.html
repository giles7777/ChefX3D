<h3>High Level</h3>
<p>
ChefX3D is a toolkit for building 3D editors.  It's expected these editors will form
part of a larger application.  Typically these editors will be customized for authoring
certain types of content.  This customization is expected to make it easier to author
that content.
<p>
Most 3D editors take the tack of making a common platform that end-user developers
add plugin functionality specific for their project.  This gives a common look and capability which
makes it easy for a 3D modeler to move between projects easily.  However, this editing capability
is not embeddable into another application.  For real applications the editing portion is
only a small task.
<p>
Some example editors this is designed for:
<ul>
   <li>Configure a simulation</li>
   <li>Author an anatomy lesson</li>
   <li>Develop a mission plan for space exploration</li>
   <li>Presentation creator for walkthroughs</li>
   <li>Author a diagnosis using DICOM images</li>
   <li>Furniture placement application</li>
   <li>Game level editor</li>
</ul>
<p>
In general this toolkit should be able to create a general 3D editor like Cosmo Worlds or 3DS Max.  But
its not the central design sweet-spot.
