Property Panel Design

Currently creates editing panel from the tool's DOM.  

Ideally would create panel from the schema.
   AppInfo would tell what special editors to use.
     File Dialog
     ComboBox
     
     
Partial Solution
   Use the userData field of DOM to store an integer for UI type.  
   

Data Editors:

Types:
   File Dialog
      extensions
   Tool
   ComboBox
      legal values
      type-in allowed
   



Example:
   Viskit Behavior
      Needs a file dialog
      Needs to update the stylesheet used for transformation
         Problem as stylesheet is a Tool property not an instance
      Needs to parse Viskit Event Graph and add a property panel
