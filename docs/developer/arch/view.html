<h1 align=center>View Design</h1>

<p>
A view is an editable display of the world model.  Common types of views might be 2D Image,
2D Vector, or 3D view.  Multiple views might be active in a viewing application at once.

<p>
<h3>View Properties</h3>
In addition to the properties an entity has defined, there will also be a set
properties defined for views.  These properties are editable while in the view.  They
include the entities location and orientation.  Its acceptable for a property to exist
in both places.
</p>
<h3>Selection Set</h3>
All views share a common selection set.  Some tools will operate on this set.

<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>
A view shall be able to undo/redo changes.  The command list will be a global list of
changes made to the model.  Anything not changing the model will not be affected, ie things
like turning on wireframe mode.

<h3>Placement Help</h3>
A view might implement a snap-to functionality.  Or a feature which helps place objects in
a tight space.  A space planner application might use this to help pack objects into a 3D space
without any of the objects penetrating or wasting space.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Views will be the largest single piece of code in the system.  The library user can
implement their own views, but its expected that most users will use the premade versions.
<h4>Model Updates</h4>
All changes made in a view must be communicated to the model.
