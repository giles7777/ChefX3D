<h1 align=center>Tool Design</h1>

<p>
A tool is an authoring widget which can create entities.  How that is accomplisted
is dependent on the tool.

<p>
<h3>Tool Types</h3>
<p>
The tool panel is where tools are selected for authoring.  Tool operation is
determined by its tool type.  The following tool types are supported:
<ul>
   <li>World - Specifies the base location</li>
   <li>Model - A locatable visual model</li>
   <li>MultiSegment - A set of lines</li>
   <li>Building - Building design tool</li>
   <li>Helper - A helper tool</li>
   <li>Controller - Controlls other entities</li>
</ul>
<p>


<h4>World</h4>
<p>
A scenario has one base location of operations.  The model is expected to
be located in world coordinates and cannot be transformed.  A location should
provide the input needed for all application views.  If its not provided then the
application will not disable that view.
<p>
A world may have a parameter space.
</p>
<h4>Model</h4>
<p>
A Model is a tool which can be positioned in 3 space.  Its created
by dragging the model onto the Main Window.  This will create a new Entity using
that model as the visual.  A model is backed by an X3D model and contains an XML
description of its parameter space.  Those parameters are modified in the Property
editor.  A behavior can be associated with an entity to drive it.
<p>
<h4>MultiSegment</h4>
<p>
A multi-segment tool is composed of several segments.  The combined object can have
a set of properties.  Another set of properties(Segement Properties) are available on each segment.
Authoring continues to create new segments until the tool is exited.
<p>
<h4>Selection</h4>
<p>
A Selection tool performs an operation on the current selection set.  After the operation is performed
the selection set will be cleared.
<p>
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>
The building tool is for authoring rough building models.  This will handle authoring a floor plan,
the number of stories and a simple roof line.  A simple texturing panel will allow textures for the
building sides and roof.
TODO: Not sure this is a really a tool type.
<p>
</p>
<h4>Helper</h4>
A helper tool is not a standalone entity.  It is edited exactly like a Model, but it will
not be treated the same for export.
<p>
<h4>Controller</h4>
An entity which controls other entities.  The location of this entity does not matter.
An example might be a Time device or the end conditions for a simulation.
<p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Every <a href="view.html">View<a/> in the system will need to understand how to render
each tool type.  Each tool will have at least a 2D image representation.  A view that has no
specific understanding of a tool can use this to render it.
