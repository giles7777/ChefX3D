<body>

<p>
ChefX3D is a toolkit for building domain-specific 3D editors. It's expected these
editors will form part of a larger application. Typically these editors will be
customized for authoring certain types of content. This customization is expected
to make it easier to author that content.
</p>
<p>
Most 3D editors take the tack of making a common platform that end-user developers
add plugin functionality specific for their project. This gives a common look
and capability which makes it easy for a 3D modeler to move between projects
easily. However, this editing capability is not embeddable into another application.
For real applications the editing portion is only a small task.
</p>
<p>
Some example editors this is designed for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure a simulation</li>
<li>Author an anatomy lesson</li>
<li>Develop a mission plan for space exploration</li>
<li>Presentation creator for walkthroughs</li>
<li>Author a diagnosis using DICOM images</li>
<li>Furniture placement application</li>
</ul>

<p>
In general this toolkit should be able to create a general 3D editor like Cosmo Worlds or
3DS Max. But its not the central design sweet-spot.
